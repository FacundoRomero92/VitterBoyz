                    <pre>
Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I don't understand

Fools like me, who cross the sea
And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs
Do you kill on God's command?

A country that's divided
Surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand

The end is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be your homelands

Holy wars

Upon my podium, as the
Know it all scholar
Down in my seat of judgement
Gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader
Out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier
Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks
Behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die.

They killed my wife, and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake...last mistake!
Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants
Next mistake...no more mistakes!

Fill the cracks in, with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings.
Next thing you know, they will take my thoughts away.

    Welcome to our fortress tall
    Take some time to show you around
    Impossible to break these walls
    For you see the steel is much too strong
    Computer banks to rule the world
    Instruments to sight the stars

    Possibly I've seen too much
    Hangar 18 I know too much.

    Foreign life forms inventory
    Suspended State of cryogenics
    Selective amnesia's the story
    Believed foretold but who'd suspect
    The military intelligence
    Two words combined that can't make sense

    Possibly I've seen too much
    Hangar 18 I know too much.

    Got on chance, infiltrate them
    Get it right, terminate them
    The Panzers will, permeate them
    Break their pride, denigrate them
    And their people, retrograde them
    Typhus, deteriate them
    Epidemic, devastate them
    Take no prisoners, cremate them

    Going to war, give 'em hell
    D-Day, next stop Normandie
    Beginning of the end
    WE know how to and sure as shit we'll win
    War is peace sure man
    A retreat for the damned
    A playground for the demented
    A haven for those who walk this world
    Bereft of heart and soul
    Love and war they say all is fair
    Take his life
    But won't take his hair
    Your body has parts your
    Country can spare
    By the way son here's
    Your wheelchair

    He once had to be all he could be
    Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see
    Funny thing, he's like you & me
    It's a funny thing, a funny thing
    Tears streak his solemn stare
    Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares
    No one knew what would happen there
    No one spoke no one even dared
    Don't ask what you can do for you country
    Ask what your country can do for you
    Take no prisoners, take no shit
